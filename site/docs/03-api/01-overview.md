# Overview

The Meta Contract DevKit is a comprehensive suite of tools and libraries designed to streamline the development process for Meta Contract projects. It provides developers with powerful utilities for scripting, testing, and managing the lifecycle of smart contract objects within the Meta Contract ecosystem.

## Key Features

1. **Scripting Utilities**: Facilitates deployment scripts and interaction sequences with built-in transaction broadcasting capabilities.

2. **Testing Helpers**: Provides a set of functions and modifiers to simulate various scenarios and streamline the testing process.

3. **Object Lifecycle Management**: Offers a robust system for managing the states and transitions of core Meta Contract objects (Function, Bundle, Proxy, Dictionary).

4. **Integration with Foundry**: Seamlessly integrates with the Foundry development environment, enhancing its capabilities for Meta Contract development.

5. **Customizable Configurations**: Allows developers to easily configure and adapt the development environment to their specific project needs.

## Components

The DevKit consists of several key components:

- **MCScript**: A base contract for deployment and interaction scripts.
- **MCTest**: A base contract for writing and running tests.
- **Core Libraries**: A collection of libraries for managing Meta Contract objects and their lifecycles.
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for common tasks in Meta Contract development.

## Getting Started
