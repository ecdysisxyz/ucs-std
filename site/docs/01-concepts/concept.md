# Getting Started

In smart contract development, dealing with domains that involve complex logic or making contracts upgradeable for operational flexibility often presents significant challenges. The Upgradeable Clone Standard (UCS) is designed as a framework to address these issues, facilitating the development of complex smart contracts for DeFi protocols, DAOs, and other applications.

UCS introduces the concept of ***Operations (Ops)***, which allows for the separation of concerns within contracts. This modular approach not only enables developers to focus more on specific domains but also facilitates collaboration among multiple developers. By breaking down complex contracts into more manageable components, UCS streamlines the development process, making it more efficient and conducive to teamwork.
