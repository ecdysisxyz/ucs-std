# CI/CD

This guide outlines the CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) practices for Meta Contract development, ensuring code quality, security, and efficient deployment processes.

## Overview

CI/CD in Meta Contract development automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying contracts. This automation helps maintain code quality, catch errors early, and streamline the deployment process.

<!-- ## Continuous Integration (CI)

### 1. Automated Testing

Every pull request triggers the following automated tests:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Gas optimization tests

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  tests:
    name: Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Foundry
        uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1
      - name: Run tests
        run: forge test
      - name: Run gas snapshot
        run: forge snapshot
```

### 2. Code Quality Checks

Automated code quality checks include:

- Solidity linting (using Solhint)
- Code formatting checks (using Prettier)

```yaml
name: Linting

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Linting
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run Solhint
        run: npx solhint 'src/**/*.sol'
      - name: Check formatting
        run: npx prettier --check '**/*.sol'
```

### 3. Security Analysis

Automated security checks using tools like:

- Slither
- Mythril

```yaml
name: Security Analysis

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    name: Security Analysis
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Slither
        uses: crytic/slither-action@v0.1.1
      - name: Run Mythril
        uses: consensys/mythril-action@v1.1.2
```

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

### 1. Staging Deployment

Automated deployment to a staging environment for final testing:

```yaml
name: Staging Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    name: Deploy to Staging
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Foundry
        uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: forge script script/DeployStaging.s.sol --rpc-url ${{ secrets.STAGING_RPC_URL }} --private-key ${{ secrets.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

### 2. Production Deployment

Deployment to production requires manual approval:

```yaml
name: Production Deployment

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  deploy-production:
    name: Deploy to Production
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Foundry
        uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: forge script script/DeployProduction.s.sol --rpc-url ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_RPC_URL }} --private-key ${{ secrets.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Use semantic versioning for releases.
2. **Environment Separation**: Maintain separate environments for development, staging, and production.
3. **Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets or a secure vault for managing sensitive information.
4. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and alerting for deployed contracts.
5. **Rollback Plan**: Always have a rollback strategy in case of deployment issues.

## Upgradeability Considerations

When deploying upgradeable Meta Contracts:

1. Ensure the upgrade process is thoroughly tested in the staging environment.
2. Implement a time-lock or multi-sig requirement for production upgrades.
3. Verify that the new implementation is compatible with the existing storage layout.

For more details on upgrades, refer to the [Upgrades Guide](../03-upgrades.md).

## Security Considerations

1. Regularly update dependencies and tooling.
2. Implement access controls for deployment and upgrade processes.
3. Conduct regular security audits, especially before major releases.

## Conclusion

Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline is crucial for maintaining the quality and security of Meta Contract projects. By automating testing, security checks, and deployment processes, teams can focus on developing innovative features while ensuring the reliability of their smart contracts.
