# The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, starting with Ethereum. It allows developers to build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL.

## Creating a Subgraph with Meta Contracts

In Meta Contracts, a subgraph is created based on Bundle's events. This allows for efficient querying and indexing of event data within the blockchain ecosystem.
