# Meta Contract

Meta Contract is a Foundry-based smart contract framework designed to create flexible, upgradeable, and scalable blockchain applications. It implements the UCS (Upgradeable Clone for Scalable Contracts) architecture, providing developers with powerful tools to build and maintain complex decentralized systems.

:::caution
Please note that as it is still in the development version, there may be potentially breaking changes made without notice. Use it with caution.

## Quick Start

Just run this:

```bash
forge init <project-name> -t metacontract/template
```

After the installation, run the following command to test the _Counter_ sample project and see how it works:

```bash
cd <project-name>
forge test
```
