<!-- Operations (Ops) are like special building blocks in UCS that shape how smart contracts behave. As a developer using UCS, you can mix and match ready-made Ops or even create and add your own to make your smart contracts more versatile. In this section, we'll cover the basics of Ops, how to use the ones that are already there, and how to make your own.

## [Standard Ops](./std-ops/)
Here, we'll dive into using the Standard Ops that UCS offers as an open-source project. Standard Ops come with common features many smart contracts need. By putting these Ops together, you can quickly build smart contracts that do a lot.

### What's Inside:
- [Overview of Standard Ops](./develop-with-std-ops/overview)
- [Integrating Standard Ops into Your Contracts](./develop-with-std-ops/integrating)
- [Best Practices for Combining Standard Ops](./develop-with-std-ops/best-practice)

## [Custom Ops](./custom-ops/)
Sometimes, you might need something unique that Standard Ops don't cover. This part will guide you through making your very own Ops, from the idea stage to getting them up and running in your UCS-based smart contracts. And of course, if your custom Ops prove to be universally useful and garner support, they could potentially be adopted as part of the Standard Ops, contributing to the broader UCS ecosystem.
